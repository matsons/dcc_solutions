Problem 1:

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return `true` since `10 + 17 = 17`

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass? (yes!)

*Idea -- turn this into a dynamic programming exercise by changing the problem to: Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether ANY set of numbers in the list sum to k.*
