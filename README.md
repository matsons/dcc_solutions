# dcp_solutions
repo to store solutions to problems distributed by [Daily Coding Problem](dailycodingproblem.com "Daily Coding Problem")

I'm not sure if all recipients of these problems receive the same problems in order or on the same day. Without this information, I've structured each solution set into folders ordered based on the order I've received them, starting with Problem1.

The aim of this repo is not to demonstrate solutions to each problem -- I'll provide solutions here and there, usually starting in Python, but I want to solve each problem in multiple languages where appropriate (if some problem can be solved with fundamentally different approaches in other languages, for instance).
